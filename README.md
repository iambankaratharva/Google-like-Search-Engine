# Indexer-and-Pagerank
An indexer and PageRank algorithm using the crawler's output - the indexer processes crawled pages to create an inverted index mapping words to URLs. The PageRank job extracts the link graph and calculates page ranks using an improved algorithm with a convergence threshold. Both components utilize the key-value store for data management.
